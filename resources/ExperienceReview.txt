	After working with our code, expanding on it, and seeing our providers version, the main thing we could have done different would be to improve our model design. Our design could be changed so we have more interfaces and classes to represent different types of cells and their contents. Our model works fine without it but there were definitely points along the way that having this implementation would have simplified things. Also, we could have made a separate interface for an editor view which would have split our visual view and GUI up nicely.
	Our experience with the providers over all went well. We requested extra files and changes in order to make our code compile (not for the implementation) and they sent us everything we needed and made the changes as well so we could compile the code. The only problem that we had was that they were supposed to send us the code over on Tuesday night (or Wednesday if they took a late day) but Friday came and we still had not received it so we had to email them and we eventually got it Saturday morning. After that, all responses were very timely and extremely helpful.
