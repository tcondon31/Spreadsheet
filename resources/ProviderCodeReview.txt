	The code we received from our providers was in very decent shape to start off with. The interfaces made intuitive sense and the implementations were very abstracted. Their view interface only consisted of three methods so it was easy to figure out how it worked and what was the necessary functionality. Overall their code was very convenient to work with, and their view was easy to use as well. Their methods and interfaces were easily adapted to work with ours. There were a few methods in their interfaces that could have had better documentation, to aid in understanding the intended functionality, though most of the method names made it easy to determine that regardless. 
	The biggest issue that we had with their code was in figuring out which methods needed to be abstracted and which were already taken care of in either our model implementation or their view implementation. Once we determined which methods we had to adjust it was easy to make their code work with ours. 
	In terms of the view itself, the most prominent thing would be that it could have been designed more dynamically. As of now, the view itself does not resize when the window resizes, and there is no scroll functionality, rather buttons that serve the same purpose. It works very well and has no recognizable errors within it, though if expanded upon could become more user-friendly and intuitive. These are all things that have to do with the GUI itself, the code for it was designed really well.
